                <h1 >Conclusions</h1>
                <p>The dataset allowed me to explore the trends and evolution of Tourism over past 23 years. The data in tableau first showed that inbound 
                    visitors are majorly arriving in the Europe and Central Asia region in comparison to other world's region. The area chart 
                    gave the deeper insight of the percetage of arrival trend and revealed that from 1995 to 2018 there is 6.5% decrease in arrival
                    of visitors in Europe and Central Asia region However, over these 23 years there is increase in arrival for East Asia and 
                    Pacific (6.2%), South Asian (1%), Middle East and North African (3.3%), which explains that the countries lying in these regions 
                    got tourists attraction over the period of time. The geo map shows emerging countries from 1995 - 2018 and found countries from Oceanic,East and South 
                    Asian regions like Japan, Australia, Thailand, and China are emerging with increase in arrival as well as revenue generation. 
                    It was also found that though the arrival in France is highest however the United States has earned more revenue over the time period.
                    The tableau dual line graph is supporting graph to geo chart to know how the tourism has evolved and how has been the revenue trend.
                    It was found that both are in upward trend. However, in 2009 there is $108 trillion decline in global revenue in tourism, which has 
                    possibly happend due to recession in that year. Similarly trade was analzed in terms of export and found the upward
                    trend however, there is sudden decrese in 2009 again, due to recession.

                    In the analysis it was also studied that Tourism do have significant impact on countries growth. Though the trend change year over year 
                    from country to country but Tourism has contributed and is contributing to employment and GDP in many countries like U.A.E., Macao China, 
                    Iceland, Maldives, New Zealand, Maldives, Seychelles, Macao Special Administrative Region, The Bahamas etc. In the study, it was also attempted to evaluate
                    which countries are emerging with highest 'average percentage growth in revenue' over last 10 years and found Top 5 countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tajikisthan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ethiopia.
                    All the analysis done in the project were really helpful in understanding
                    the global travel and tourism trends and its impact.
